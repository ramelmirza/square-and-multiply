# Square and Multiply Algorithm

This program was created for my former math teacher where a big component of the course was revolving around number theory.
It is intended to be used as a study guide to aid the discrete math & stats students with studying.
Simply input the base, exponent, and modulo, and the program will compute the number it's congruent to in it's non-zero form.
There are many ways to compute this program in terms of time complexity. However, as time goes on and I get more exposed to
mathematics, I will keep coming back to this on a later date in order to find the fastest algorithm that I can build during said time.

Example: $$
         193^{53} \mod 673
         $$
